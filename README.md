# PeopleAndCars

Simple shiny webapp where we're looking at data from cbs involving population and cars. 
The shiny webapp can be found at : https://peterbolier.shinyapps.io/PeopleAndCars/

How does the number of cars in the Netherlands depend on:
- the population
- the lenght of all the roads (in the Netherlands)
- the length of all the railroads (in the Netherlands)

One moght expect that:
- the more people the more cars
- the more road the more cars
- the more railroad the less cars.

Its not a serious set up, the simple linear regression models are ot quite right (yet).
