# PeopleAndCars

Simple shiny webapp where we're looking at data from cbs involving population and cars. 
The shiny webapp can be found at : https://peterbolier.shinyapps.io/PeopleAndCars/

How does the number of cars in the Netherlands depend on:
- the population
- the lenght of all the roads (in the Netherlands)
- the length of all the railroads (in the Netherlands)

One might expect that:
- the more people, the more cars,
- the more roads, the more cars,
- the more railroads, the less cars.

It's not a serious set up, the simple linear regression models are not quite right (yet).
